iosWorkflows
============

You've stumbled upon this little project of mine a bit early, feel free to explore or contribute but realize this is very much a work in progress.

It seems like we've recently been seeing a ton of new ideas and tools for creating better workflows between iOS apps. From Launch Center Pro, to incredible new Drafts & Mr. Reader actions and services and even more powerful possibilities created by Pythonista there's a whole new world for iOS power users to explore.

This project began as an adventure to learn JavaScript, Python and GitHub as well as a way for me to improve my productivity when I'm working on my iOS devices. As it grew from one long markdown file to several different app files with bookmarklets, Drafts & Launch Center Pro actions, Mr. Reader services and soon Pythonista scripts I decided to get more organized and setup a GitHub repository.

I hope some of these workflows and tools could be useful for others, if anyone else would like to contribute their own bits all the better!

One note to keep in mind, this is my first time really using JavaScript or Python, if I've made any mistakes or if my code could be improved to be more semantic, valid or efficient I would welcome the feedback or new branches.
