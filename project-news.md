## Project updates

Just pushed a *huge* update. 

Here are a few highlights:

- New workflows and improvements throughout the project. Check out the [Pinbook](pinbook.md) workflows in particular.
- Restructured all of the Markdown files for easier browsing and navigation.
- Created [template.md](template.md) to help keep things organized and consistent. If you want to pitch in with new workflows or entirely new apps this is the place to start.
- Started a new [Guide](guide.md) with directions for [installing Drafts Actions](guide.md#installing-drafts-actions) and [Mr. Reader Services](guide.md#installing-mr-reader-browser-and-other-app-services) as well as notes on [bookmarklet limitations and workarounds with different browsers](guide.md#bookmarklet-limitations-for-selected-text-in-different-browsers).
- Updated the [README](README.md) with social and contact information as well as contributors.
- Broke off the news section into a different [Project News](project-news.md) file.
- Uploaded Mr. Reader service files for easier installation.

Hopefully I've got things stable now and future updates will be smaller and more iterative.
